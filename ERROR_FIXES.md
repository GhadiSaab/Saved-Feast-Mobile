# Error Fixes Summary

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve the errors encountered in the SavedFeast mobile application.

## Fixed Errors

### 1. Image Loading Errors ✅

**Problem**: Images were failing to load with various path formats:
- `meals/meal-3.jpg`
- `/storage/meals/fiiS7fF815Wi6Q7rGtTEzTWkTdnU8jkD5N3SOXps.jpg`
- `meals/meal-9.jpg`

**Root Cause**: Image URLs from the API were not properly formatted for mobile access. The paths needed to be converted to full URLs.

**Solution**:
- Created `lib/imageUtils.ts` with `formatImageUrl()` function
- Handles different path formats:
  - Laravel storage paths (`/storage/meals/...`)
  - Relative paths (`meals/...`)
  - Full URLs (passed through unchanged)
- Updated `MealCard.tsx` and `MealDetailModal.tsx` to use the utility
- Added better error logging to show both original and formatted URLs

**Files Created**:
- `lib/imageUtils.ts`
- `__tests__/lib/imageUtils.test.ts` (6/6 tests passing)

**Files Modified**:
- `components/MealCard.tsx`
- `components/MealDetailModal.tsx`

### 2. Notification Project ID Error ✅

**Problem**: 
```
ERROR Error getting push token: [Error: Error encountered while fetching Expo token, expected an OK response, received: 400 (body: "{"errors":[{"code":"VALIDATION_ERROR","type":"USER","message":"\"projectId\": Invalid uuid.","isTransient":false,"requestId":"c7f0b1c7-4e21-4641-9fa2-7e98d6204e2e"}]}").]
```

**Root Cause**: The notification service was using a placeholder project ID (`'your-project-id'`) which is not a valid UUID.

**Solution**:
- Added environment variable support for project ID (`EXPO_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID`)
- Added fallback logic to skip token generation when using placeholder ID
- Added better error handling to prevent app crashes
- Added check for Expo Go environment (notifications not fully supported)

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/notifications.ts`

### 3. Route Warning ✅

**Problem**:
```
WARN [Layout children]: No route named "(auth)" exists in nested children: ["+not-found", "checkout", "debug", "favorites", "login", "order-confirmation", "orders", "privacy-policy", "profile", "settings", "signup", "terms-of-service", "_sitemap", "(auth)/login", "(auth)/signup", "(tabs)"]
```

**Root Cause**: Duplicate auth route files existed - both individual files (`login.tsx`, `signup.tsx`) and directory structure (`(auth)/login.tsx`, `(auth)/signup.tsx`).

**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate individual auth files
- Kept only the `(auth)` directory structure for proper routing
- This resolves the route conflict and warning

**Files Removed**:
- `app/login.tsx`
- `app/signup.tsx`

## Additional Improvements

### Better Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error logging for image loading failures
- Added graceful fallbacks for notification registration
- Improved error messages for debugging

### Testing
- Created unit tests for image utility functions
- All tests passing (6/6 for imageUtils)
- Maintained existing notification service tests (5/5 passing)

### Development Experience
- Added better console logging for debugging
- Added environment variable support for configuration
- Added checks for development vs production environments

## Environment Configuration

To fully enable notifications, set the following environment variable:
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-expo-project-id
```

## Testing Results

- ✅ Image utility tests: 6/6 passing
- ✅ Notification service tests: 5/5 passing
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ All route warnings resolved

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Images**: Should now load properly with correctly formatted URLs
2. **Notifications**: Will work in development builds, gracefully handle Expo Go limitations
3. **Routing**: No more route warnings, clean navigation structure
4. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and graceful fallbacks

The app should now run without the reported errors and provide a better user experience.
