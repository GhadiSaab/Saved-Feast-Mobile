# Search and Filter Functionality Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve the search bar and filter functionality issues in the SavedFeast mobile application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Search Bar Not Working ✅

**Problem**: Search bar was not triggering searches properly when users typed.

**Root Causes**:
- Improper debouncing implementation
- Search was only triggered on certain conditions (length > 2)
- No immediate search on submit
- Missing proper timeout management

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper debounced search with 500ms delay
- Added immediate search on form submission
- Added proper timeout cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Added clear search functionality with visual feedback
- Added comprehensive debugging logs

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// New debounced search handler
const handleSearchInput = (text: string) => {
  setSearchTerm(text);
  
  // Clear any existing timeout
  if (searchTimeout) {
    clearTimeout(searchTimeout);
  }
  
  // Set a new timeout for debounced search
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
    setFilters(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      search: text,
      page: 1,
    }));
  }, 500); // 500ms debounce
  
  setSearchTimeout(timeout);
};
```

### 2. Filters Not Working ✅

**Problem**: Category filters were not applying properly to meal results.

**Root Causes**:
- Filters were being set but not properly triggering API calls
- Missing debugging to identify filter application issues
- Potential issues with filter state management

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive debugging for filter state changes
- Ensured filters properly trigger React Query refetch
- Added visual feedback for filter selection
- Improved filter state management

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// Enhanced category filter handler
const handleCategoryChange = (categoryId: number | '') => {
  animateCategorySelection();
  setSelectedCategory(categoryId);
  console.log('Category changed to:', categoryId);
  setFilters(prev => {
    const newFilters = {
      ...prev,
      category_id: typeof categoryId === 'number' ? categoryId : undefined,
      page: 1,
    };
    console.log('Updated filters for category:', newFilters);
    return newFilters;
  });
};
```

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Search Experience
- **Debounced Search**: 500ms delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Immediate Search**: Search triggers immediately on form submission
- **Clear Functionality**: Users can easily clear search with visual button
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear button appears when text is entered

### 2. Better Filter Management
- **Visual Selection**: Selected categories are highlighted
- **Animation**: Smooth animations for filter interactions
- **State Persistence**: Filter state is properly managed
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### 3. API Integration
- **Proper Parameter Handling**: All filter parameters are correctly sent to API
- **Query Key Management**: React Query properly invalidates on filter changes
- **Error Handling**: Better error handling for failed searches/filters

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Debouncing**: Prevents excessive API calls during typing
- **Timeout Cleanup**: Prevents memory leaks from abandoned timeouts
- **Query Caching**: Leverages React Query caching for better performance

## Debugging Features Added

### Search Debugging
```typescript
console.log('Triggering search with term:', text);
console.log('Updated filters:', newFilters);
```

### Filter Debugging
```typescript
console.log('Category changed to:', categoryId);
console.log('Updated filters for category:', newFilters);
```

### API Debugging
```typescript
console.log('Raw filters received:', filters);
console.log(`Added param: ${key}=${value}`);
console.log('Query function called with filters:', filters);
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Search Bar
- ✅ Real-time search with debouncing
- ✅ Clear search button when text is present
- ✅ Immediate search on form submission
- ✅ Proper keyboard handling (no dismissal on typing)
- ✅ Visual feedback for search state

### Filters
- ✅ Category selection with visual feedback
- ✅ Smooth animations for interactions
- ✅ Proper filter application
- ✅ Easy filter clearing
- ✅ Responsive filter panel

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests for search and filter functionality:
- Search input rendering
- Debounced search triggering
- Clear button functionality
- Filter button and panel
- Category selection
- API integration

**Test File**: `__tests__/components/SearchFunctionality.test.tsx`

## Files Modified

### Core Functionality
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Main search and filter implementation
- `lib/meals.ts` - Enhanced API debugging

### Testing
- `__tests__/components/SearchFunctionality.test.tsx` - Comprehensive tests

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Search Functionality
1. **Typing**: Search triggers automatically after 500ms of no typing
2. **Submit**: Search triggers immediately when user presses search button
3. **Clear**: Users can clear search with the X button
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear button appears when text is entered

### Filter Functionality
1. **Category Selection**: Categories can be selected and applied immediately
2. **Visual Feedback**: Selected categories are highlighted
3. **Filter Panel**: Opens/closes smoothly with animations
4. **State Management**: Filter state persists correctly

### API Integration
1. **Proper Parameters**: All search and filter parameters are sent to API
2. **Query Management**: React Query properly handles filter changes
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors
4. **Performance**: Debounced requests prevent excessive API calls

## Debugging

To debug search and filter issues, check the console logs for:
- Filter state changes
- API parameter construction
- Query function calls
- Search term updates

The enhanced logging will help identify any remaining issues with search or filter functionality.
