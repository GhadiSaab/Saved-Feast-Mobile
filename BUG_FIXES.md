# Mobile App Bug Fixes

This document outlines the bug fixes implemented in the SavedFeast mobile application.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Meal Pictures Not Showing ✅

**Problem**: Meal images were not displaying properly in the app.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper error handling to the `Image` component from `expo-image`
- Added `onError` callback to log failed image loads
- Added `transition` property for smoother image loading
- Enhanced placeholder display when images fail to load

**Files Modified**:
- `components/MealCard.tsx`
- `components/MealDetailModal.tsx`

### 2. Search Bar Keyboard Issues ✅

**Problem**: Search bar keyboard was disappearing on each keystroke and search wasn't working properly.

**Solution**:
- Modified the `onChangeText` handler to trigger search as user types (with debounce)
- Added `blurOnSubmit={false}` to prevent keyboard dismissal
- Added `autoCorrect={false}` and `autoCapitalize="none"` for better search experience
- Search now triggers when user types more than 2 characters or clears the search

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

### 3. Favorites Page Not Opening ✅

**Problem**: Favorites button in profile was showing an alert instead of opening a proper favorites page.

**Solution**:
- Created a new `favorites.tsx` screen with full functionality
- Implemented proper favorites list with meal cards
- Added empty state with call-to-action
- Added error handling and loading states
- Updated profile screen to navigate to the new favorites page

**Files Created**:
- `app/favorites.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`
- `app/_layout.tsx` (added favorites route)

### 4. Push Notification System for Order Tracking ✅

**Problem**: No push notifications for order status updates.

**Solution**:
- Installed and configured `expo-notifications`, `expo-device`, and `expo-constants`
- Created a comprehensive notification service (`lib/notifications.ts`)
- Created notification context for app-wide notification management
- Added notification permissions to `app.json`
- Integrated notifications into order confirmation and orders screens
- Added support for different order status notifications:
  - Order Confirmed (PENDING)
  - Order Accepted (ACCEPTED)
  - Order Ready for Pickup (READY_FOR_PICKUP)
  - Order Completed (COMPLETED)
  - Order Cancelled (CANCELLED_BY_CUSTOMER/CANCELLED_BY_RESTAURANT)
  - Order Expired (EXPIRED)

**Files Created**:
- `lib/notifications.ts`
- `context/NotificationContext.tsx`
- `__tests__/components/NotificationService.test.ts`
- `__tests__/components/FavoritesScreen.test.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `app.json` (added notification permissions and plugins)
- `app/_layout.tsx` (added NotificationProvider)
- `app/order-confirmation.tsx` (integrated notifications)
- `app/(tabs)/orders.tsx` (integrated notifications)
- `package.json` (added notification dependencies)
